**Find Default (Prediction of Credit Card fraud) Project Summary**

**Problem Statement:**

A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.


**Project Overview:**

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on developing a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the financial sector's increasing dependence on digital transactions, this project aims to provide a robust, scalable solution to detect and prevent fraud in real-time, thereby protecting customers and financial institutions from significant financial losses.

**Key Objectives:**

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance through techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Model Development: Implement a machine learning model, focusing on logistic regression, to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.

Evaluation and Validation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure high reliability in detecting fraud.

Deployment: Package the model into a deployable format using Docker, create an API service for real-time predictions, and ensure the solution is scalable and secure.

**Key Design Choices:**

Data Handling: Given the high imbalance in the dataset (fraudulent transactions are rare), SMOTE was used to balance the classes, ensuring the model could learn effectively from both positive and negative cases.

Model Selection: Logistic regression was chosen for its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Performance Metrics: Multiple metrics were used to ensure the model's reliability, focusing on minimizing false positives and false negatives, which are crucial in fraud detection.

**Outcomes:**

High Accuracy: The model achieved high accuracy in predicting fraudulent transactions, with strong precision and recall, ensuring that genuine transactions are not falsely flagged while most fraud cases are caught.

Scalability: The model is designed to be deployed in a production environment, with the ability to handle large volumes of transactions in real-time.

Security: The deployment plan includes data encryption and access controls, ensuring that the model operates securely within the financial institution's ecosystem.

**Future Work:**

Algorithm Enhancement: Exploring more complex models like Random Forests or Neural Networks for potentially higher accuracy.

Real-time Deployment: Implementing real-time fraud detection using streaming data to immediately flag and investigate suspicious transactions.

Continuous Learning: Setting up a pipeline to retrain the model with new data, allowing it to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates a thorough approach to addressing the challenge of credit card fraud detection, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and future improvements. The model is not only effective but also ready for real-world application, offering a scalable solution to a critical problem in the financial industry.
